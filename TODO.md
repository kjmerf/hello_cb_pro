Next steps:
  - Implement more order types
  - Be smarter about networking (i.e. check for order success)
  - Stub out more parts of the API
    - There's already a Python SDK for this but I think we'd benefit from basically writing our own, since we don't need to expose it publicly and we're still so much in the learning stage.

Need-to-figure-out:
  - Unique order IDs
  - Object model (different types of orders, etc.)
  - ...
